Also, the project was consisted of a Potable Water System (PWS), to include water wells protected in enclosed well houses, water well pumps, steel storage tank(s) (GST), booster pump(s), expansion tank(s), hydro pneumatic tank(s), and an underground pipe distribution network system intended to connect smaller cantonments on the garrison into a central water system served by a single pressure zone. On electrical side, the project was to design and construct a new electrical distribution system extended in a loop design from the North Substation-SKAIA feeder. System was built in medium voltage overhead feeders, switches, sectionalizers, reclosure devices, underground medium voltage and low voltage distribution, pad mounted transformers, and unit substations to feed the facilities in the South Kabul Afghanistan International Airport area.",
