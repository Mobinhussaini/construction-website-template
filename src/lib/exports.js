            "Inside the Global Gate studio, we share a belief in the transformational power of people united in a common purpose. Our goal is to create places that draw people together, serve, and inspire. This belief manifests itself in collaboration. That means ongoing communication in the studio and with our design team, a lack of ego from the top down, and a collection of highly-capable, enthusiastic design professionals. Our staff are all exceptional designers and, rare within the profession, the majority are registered architects. Collaboration extends beyond the studio to embrace our clients. With each commission we actively engage our clients and listen attentively to uncover the unique qualities of their project and site. The aim of this effort is to reveal not only the client’s top-of-mind goals, but also latent functional and aspirational goals, as these often determine the real success of a project. Our portfolio is evidence of this empathetic focus, rarely repeating a style, strategy, or solution from one project to the next. Clients tell us they value our ability to create designs that reflect their unique needs and personality. From military bases and force protection projects to commercial works and homes, we have earned a reputation for timeless design and an expertise in tackling unusual projects. These qualities and sustained design excellence caused Global Gate to collect and team up the most experienced and qualified designers of the country. A summary of the design projects which our team have completed so far are presented in this chart.",
